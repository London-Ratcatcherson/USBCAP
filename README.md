# USBCAP
Win32 VFW app created to test Windows 95. Still works in Win 8.1!

This is a simple, minimal Win32 video capture app that uses a Legacy but still functional API.
I used this as a guide to getting started on my much more ambitious VFW64 application, 
checked into its own repository. The advantage to USBCAP is its elegant simplicity.
